## 🔍 Problem Statement

Hospitals face challenges in managing patient inflow and resource allocation. One key metric is **Length of Stay (LOS)**, which impacts:
- Bed availability
- Staffing
- Operational efficiency

The goal is to build a machine learning model that predicts LOS category based on features like:
- Age
- Severity of Illness
- Type of Admission
- Hospital region/type
- Department, Ward type, etc.

## 📊 Models Used

- ✅ Random Forest
- ✅ XGBoost
- ✅ LightGBM
- ✅ Multilayer Perceptron (Neural Network)

Each model was trained on balanced data using **SMOTE** and evaluated on a held-out validation set.
